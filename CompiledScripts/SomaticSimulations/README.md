**AnalyzeFastSim1Coal2-NullD1S11G12.R** was used to analyze allele frequency distributions of simulated somatic sites

**FastSimCoal2-NullD1S100G12.bash** was used to simulate somatic sites using FastSimCoal2

**summarize-FastSimCoal2-NullD1S100G12.bash** was used to produce summary files of allele frequency information from FastSimCoal2 outputs for analysis
